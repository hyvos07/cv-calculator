<h1 align="center"> Genshin Impact Crit Value Calculator </h1>

<p align="justify">This is a project about Genshin Impact Crit Value (CV) Calculator that are made with <b>Python</b> and <b>Tkinter GUI Interface</b>.</p>

<p align="justify">I made this program since I don't see any online resource or website <i>(CMIIW)</i> that can calculate an artifact's CV. Even if it's pretty easy to calculate your own artifact's CV, I'm sure that some people (or might just me :p) that are kind of lazy to do some math problem while they're playing a game.</p>
